/**
 * The {@code ComicBook} class represents a type of literature that extends the {@link Literature} class.
 * This class includes a predefined list of popular comic book titles and allows setting and getting the title
 * of an individual comic book.
 *
 * <p>
 * It overrides the {@code getTitle()} method from the {@code Literature} class to return the title of the comic book,
 * and also overrides the {@code toString()} method to return a string representation of the comic book.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The list of popular comic books is stored in the {@code TITLES} array as a collection of famous comic titles,
 * such as "Watchmen", "The Dark Knight Returns", and others.
